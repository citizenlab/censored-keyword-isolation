# censored-keyword-isolation

Algorithms for performing sample testing to determine keyword combinations used
to trigger automatic filtering of text-based content.

This code accompanies the paper "[An Efficient Method to Determine which
Combination of Keywords Triggered Automatic Filtering of a Message](
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/foci19-paper_xiong.pdf)" by Ruohan Xiong
and Jeffrey Knockel (2019). For the last version with all of the algorithms
evaluated in the paper (including the bad ones), see
[this commit](https://github.com/citizenlab/censored-keyword-isolation/tree/37f9cc44).
The master branch only maintains algorithms that you would ever want to use.
